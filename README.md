# Introduction

This is a repository to test a few algorithms to detect 
best sampling rate on a network for decision making.
This is part of my graduate research thesis. 
As the testbench I will use OpenFlow, Mininet.
References to software, tutorials, guides and paper I used will (not exhaustively)
be listed below.

# TODOS

- [x] Create Basic Topologies
- [ ] Setup Traffic via Scapy (or other tool).
- [ ] Setup Self-Similar Traffic
- [ ] Implement Time Sampling
- [ ] Create a `dpctl.c` modification to allow for sampling.
